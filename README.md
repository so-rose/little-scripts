These are little tools that help my life along. Run each with -h for deeper info:


### **Requires ffmpeg**

-**mled**: Simple H.264/mp4 processing, most notably removing/adding sound files (great when I render out a better mix for a finished film).

-**mlov**: Easily & *quickly* make an mp4 from an image sequence. More options for shallow quality control.

### **Requires djv-view**

-**sek**: The universal sequence viewer! Point sek at directories & MOVs alike - it'll open up djv-view to play it!
